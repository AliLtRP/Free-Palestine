            I am a dedicated individual who has developed a web app focused on shedding light on the complex and enduring
            conflict between Palestine and Israel. Driven by a profound desire to foster understanding and awareness, I have
            created a platform that delves into the historical intricacies and contemporary challenges surrounding this
            conflict.
